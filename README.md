# Underground-life
Underground Life is a modpack about a post-apocalyptic world, but it's not exactly standard. In it you appear in a bunker, because outside there is radiation and without the right equipment you will die. There are no villages here, just small bunker settlements where there will be a couple of traders and resources, but if you do not like the inhabitants you can just rob them or rob the extinct city And much more in my compilation
